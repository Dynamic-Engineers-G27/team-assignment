To check my understanding. Run your git remote-v to note your alias, push and pull links. If you have not pushed before then you need to mkdir and do a git clone first into it. This will synchronize your local with the remote repo. Then you can git pull before you finally push. If however, you have pushed before to this repository then for subsequent pushes, all you need to do is just git pull first (each time) to synchronize your local with the remote repo first before you do your next git push.
